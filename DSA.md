## Interview tips
* Properly understand the problem. Ask clarifying questions, and also ask about constraints if not provided. Just don't assume anything. Ask everything in the beginning before you jump into solving it.
* Tell brute force first , then incrementally for optimal solution.
* Maybe, first write your approach in comments at the top. This small tip could be super helpful.
* They are checking your Communication also. Explanation should be crystal clear. Don't assume that interviewer is a friend. Explain him thoroughly. If you choose any algorithm then give him proper intuition that why you think that intuition will work, rather than simply telling him high level.
* Keep asking him is everything clear upto now, or was there any part I should explain in more depth?
* Don't be silent for too long. Doesn't leave good impression. Try to break ice at specific intervals if silence is too long. May use fillers like "Questions would have been simpler if....", "Thought for this approach but this won't work because of this problem...", etc.
* If stuck for too long, then be shameless and ask "Could you share any hint?"

## DSA tips
* Use good varible names, even they are little long, they make things more intuitive.
* In graph, if constraints are 1-based then don't forget to -1 them to offset because generally we use 0-based indexed arrays.
